# A Kubernetes File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) Sidecar Demo
A proof of concept project to show how a Kubernetes sidecar can monitor the file integrity of another container. The purpose of this project isn't to
provide production quality code; it's simply to show that it is possible to have a sidecar container monitor the file integrity of another container and to
take remedial action if a container is hacked.
